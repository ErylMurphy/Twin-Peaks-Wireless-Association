Wish for Wheels is a Denver-based nonprofit whose mission is to transform the lives of kids from low-income families, broadening their scope for personal growth and a healthy lifestyle through the gift of a new bicycle. Wish for Wheels’ main model is to partner with companies/organizations that fund the bikes, build them as a team and then directly give the bikes to the K-2 kids whose lives are changed through the program. More than 14,000 children have received new bikes and helmets through Wish for Wheels and COWA is proud to be a part of this movement.
